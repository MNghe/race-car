<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The objective of this project is to **create a cheap 1/18th race car with a deep-learning model that can be operated by students at a high school level**. Once the model is established and simplified enough, we will begin introducing this project to high schoolers to get them aware of this developing field. After there is a decent population of people working on their version of this project, the next objective would be to develop a friendly racing competition for students to compete with each other and push their understanding further in a healthy and encouraging environment.
